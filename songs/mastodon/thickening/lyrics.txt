With the lights down low
Wrapped up like a baby
And your hair hangs long
Surrounding my face

Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping you'll be the last

Love your warm embrace
Hold me close don't let me go
Nipple pink and cold
Filled up with mother's milk

Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping you'll be the last

With the lights down low
Wrapped up like a baby
And your hair hangs long
Surrounding my face

Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping you'll be the last
