I burned out my eyes
I cut off my tongue
I sealed them with all of the silver
And now I have none

You killed the life
You took the diamond
You killed the vine
Death of the...

You own the darkness
And taken my sight
You buried the stars underground
You've stolen the night

You can run to the sea
You can run to the forest
You can hide
But you'll never escape

You've run out of lies
You've run out of time

You killed the life
You took the diamond
You killed the vine
Death of the sun
