I will just keep waiting...
you will just keep waiting. In the cold...
The supplement...
we lost some friends...
we drove the bends...
so small...

A conscious decision to persuade ourselves amongst the common human...
The drive to complete ourselves has become a blurry vision.
Always wanting more...
bettering ourselves through selfish minds.
it has started to overflow.
A current that creates this undertow...
swimming beneath it all...

=============

I will just keep waiting...
you will just keep waiting.
I will just keep waiting...
You will just keep waiting.
I will just keep waiting...
You will just keep waiting.
I will just keep waiting...
Obsession.
Obsessive.
Obsessed.
Abscess.
Obsession.
Obsessive.
Obsessed.
Abscess.
Rip out my fucking eyes.
I can’t watch you grow into this.
I can’t watch the young turn to all of this.
Their eyes left wide...
Night goggles instead of sleep.
night goggles instead of sleep.
Live life...you have all helped me break from this...
the few times relaxation steps in bringing me a peaceful place.
Live life... you have all helped me break from this...

It’s a must these days, for the colors are fading.
It’s a must these days, for the colors are fading.
It’s a must these days, for the colors are fading.
It’s a must these days, for the colors are fading.
Enclosed in a space of soothing sounds.
Walking in my own movie...
The fly by with no remembrance.
Constant rushing...
The waves have pushed me to where I need to be.
Walking in my own movie...
The fly by with no remembrance.
Constant rushing...
the waves have pushed me to where I need to be.
Sunlight drenched on my skin...
Only the sounds of what my mind wants to hear.
Block out the rush hour...
block out the tired herds...
Only the sounds of what my mind wants to hear.
Block out the rush hour...
Block out the tired herds...
On the shaded side, it’s starting to affect the process of your reading eyes.
An aggressive need for a hostile voice is creeping away...
this block happens every year...
and like I said before the color keeps fading.
This block happens every year...
I couldn’t trade this for anything in the world...
This block happens every year...
And all of you are the reason.
This block happens every year...
It’s been a while since we’ve written each other and hopefully this will comfort you.
‘Cause like most of my kind, I won’t take it all for granted.
I will just keep waiting...you will just keep waiting.
It’s a must these days, for the colors are fading.
It’s a must these days, for the colors are fading.
It’s a must these days, for the colors are fading.
