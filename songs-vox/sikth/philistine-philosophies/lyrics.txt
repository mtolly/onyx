We saw the golden age
Digitally decay
Under the ruins now
I see a carrion crow, carrion crow
Now he be championing
These philistine philosophies
This wretched industry
Keeps on spitting out clones, spitting out clones
The world we love in disarray
The world we loved became estranged
Lost! We're sinking, we're sinking, we're sinking now
Lost! What can we do? What's next now?
Lost! We're sinking, we're sinking, we're sinking now
Lost! In an endless commentary
As every thought is spouted out
All the lights go out
So hop on the wagon or
Be a mystical tree, a mystical tree
In the age of monotony
And philistine philosophies
Condensing everything into a digital hole, a digital hole
We see a pathetic final lap
They're falling like dominos, falling like dominos
We see sugar coaters selling clones
Falling like dominos
Falling like dominos
The world we love in disarray
The world we loved became estranged
Well now we don't know where we're at because
There's too much congestion and a lack of invention
Material eyes require constant attention
It's the mystery lost in a web, in the well
As the spider awakes and decides what to sell
Hold my to hope we fly beyond the coal
You can't lose what you don't know
So you can't find what isn't yours
It's just a new era evolved
Or have we devolved?
Eyes seems to come through the wall
Mechanical wizardry rule
Suppressing the waves in the wool
Keep on staring at the screen
Losing light, tainting sight, while we then light up the candle
While stranded, no handle on what comes next
Anti-passion makes an empty old din
Because a fearful eye's pulling strings for thee
Watch on
Round and round and round it goes
Human nature!
Round and round and round it goes
Human nature!
Round and round and round it goes
Human nature!
Round and round and round it goes
Human nature!
