The temple of bodies
A building with souls
Given the cosmos
As we let go
As we let go

Locked in a dance
Surrounding the moon
This far from the clouds
Stargasm flows
Stargasm

Lead us by horses
On the way to our graves
Father the owl
It is your faith
It is your faith

Awake in the moment
Awaken the heart
Look to the spirits
Stargasm glows
Stargasm

And then we shift into overdrive
But you're not here
And your legs and the stars collide
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire

Henged from solstice
Bohemian grove
Flesh lies the altar
As we let go
As we let go

Glasses are empty
The owl has flown
Sever relation
Like you didn't know
Like you didn't know

And then we shift into overdrive
But you're not here
And your legs and the stars collide
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire
