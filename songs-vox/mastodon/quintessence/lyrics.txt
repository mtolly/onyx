The demon skin is covered in fine mist
Opened his hand in my hand
Holding my eyes to the future
Hovering above myself
Letting loose the guided
Punching these holes in my head
The space time paradigm

Omnipresence
Primal instincts

Let it go

Calling reason
Finding you
These wild hearts run
Even deeper
Burning through
These wild hearts run

Let it go

Letting me free the quintessence
In fine mist
Opened his hand in center
Holding my eyes to the future
Letting loose the guided
Punching these holes in my head
Losing my skin to the landslide

Omnipresence
Primal instinct

Let it go

Calling reason
Finding you
These wild hearts run
Even deeper
Burning through
These wild hearts run

Let it go

Shield failure
Speed farewell
