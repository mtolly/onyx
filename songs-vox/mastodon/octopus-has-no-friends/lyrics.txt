To tempt the fool into the mine
Let loose the snake with antidote

Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always
Always

I'm on my way back home
I'm on my way back home

I see your face inside the smoke
It's hard to scream and nice to choke

Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always
Always

I'm on my way back home
I'm on my way back home

Let's rest awhile inside the cave
Don't cry you'll see that we'll be safe

Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always
Always

Take your heart into your hand
Always
Take your heart into your hand
Always

I'm on my way back home
I'm on my way back home
